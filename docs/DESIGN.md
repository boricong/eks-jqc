## Overview

Notion looks like a well-organized desk in good daylight. The dominant surface is not pure white but a warm, paper-soft off-white — `{colors.canvas-soft}` (#f6f5f4) — that takes the clinical edge off the screen and makes long pages feel like a document rather than an app. Type is set in `NotionInter` (a tuned Inter) in near-black `{colors.ink}` at large, tightly-tracked weights, so headlines read as confident statements with very little letter-spacing slack at display sizes (`{typography.display-1}` pulls −2.125px of tracking at 64px). The whole system whispers in greys and blacks, then says exactly one thing in colour: a single, dependable blue, `{colors.primary}` (#0075de), reserved almost entirely for the primary call-to-action and inline links.

Against that quiet chrome, Notion lets a **playful multi-colour sticker palette** carry all of the brand's personality — purple, pink, orange, teal, green and sky-blue appear as small illustrated blocks, app-icon stickers, and category dots scattered through the marketing pages. These colours never structure the layout or paint a CTA; they decorate. The discipline is deliberate: the interface stays monochrome-plus-blue so the content (and the cheerful illustrations) can breathe. The one exception to the bright daylight is the homepage hero, which inverts into a deep indigo "night" band (`{colors.secondary}`) with white type and glowing sticker constellations — a single dark island in an otherwise light document.

Surfaces are defined by hairlines and the faintest layered shadows rather than heavy elevation. Cards round at a friendly 12px (`{rounded.lg}`), the marketing CTAs are fully-pill-shaped (`{rounded.full}`), and utility buttons round at a tighter 8px (`{rounded.md}`). Nothing is loud; the brand's character comes from restraint plus one well-placed splash of joy.

**Key Characteristics:**
- Warm paper-soft canvas `{colors.canvas-soft}` over pure white, never clinical
- Near-black `{colors.ink}` `NotionInter` type with tight negative tracking at display sizes (`{typography.display-1}`)
- Exactly one structural accent — Notion blue `{colors.primary}` — reserved for CTAs and links
- A decorative-only multi-colour sticker palette (`{colors.accent-purple}`, `{colors.accent-pink}`, `{colors.accent-orange}`, `{colors.accent-teal}`, `{colors.accent-green}`, `{colors.accent-sky}`) that adds personality without ever painting structure
- Pill-shaped marketing CTAs (`{rounded.full}`) contrasted with 8px utility buttons (`{rounded.md}`)
- Elevation by hairline + barely-there layered shadow, not heavy drop-shadows
- A single dark indigo hero "night" band (`{colors.secondary}`) inverting the otherwise daylight page rhythm

## Colors

> Source pages analysed: the Notion home page plus Pricing, Enterprise, Product (AI), Product (Agents), and Startups. Every secondary page resolved to the same core palette — Notion runs one tightly-scoped system across the marketing site.

### Brand & Accent
- **Notion Blue** (`{colors.primary}` — #0075de): the single structural accent. Primary CTA fill ("Get Notion free"), inline link colour, active-tab and focus signal. This is the only colour that ever paints an action.
- **Pressed Blue** (`{colors.primary-active}` — #005bab): the darker press state of the primary CTA.
- **Deep Indigo** (`{colors.secondary}` — #213183): the dark hero "night" band background and its sticker-constellation field; a deep brand-blue used for full-bleed inverted sections.

The remaining colours form Notion's **decorative sticker palette** — they appear only as illustrated blocks, app stickers and category dots, never as CTAs or structural fills:
- **Sticker Sky** (`{colors.accent-sky}` — #62aef0)
- **Sticker Purple** (`{colors.accent-purple}` — #d6b6f6) / **Deep Purple** (`{colors.accent-purple-deep}` — #391c57)
- **Sticker Pink** (`{colors.accent-pink}` — #ff64c8)
- **Sticker Orange** (`{colors.accent-orange}` — #dd5b00) / **Deep Orange** (`{colors.accent-orange-deep}` — #793400)
- **Sticker Teal** (`{colors.accent-teal}` — #2a9d99)
- **Sticker Green** (`{colors.accent-green}` — #1aae39)
- **Sticker Brown** (`{colors.accent-brown}` — #523410)

### Surface
- **White** (`{colors.canvas}` / `{colors.surface}` — #ffffff): card and panel surfaces, nav bar, form fields.
- **Warm Paper** (`{colors.canvas-soft}` — #f6f5f4): the signature page canvas and the footer band — a warm off-white that gives the whole site its document-like calm.
- **Hairline** (`{colors.hairline}` — #e6e6e6): 1px card borders and dividers, a black-at-10%-on-white blend kept solid for token reuse.

### Text
- **Ink** (`{colors.ink}` — #000000): primary headings and body text (rendered at ~95% alpha for a soft true-black).
- **Warm Charcoal** (`{colors.ink-secondary}` — #31302e): secondary body copy and footer text.
- **Stone** (`{colors.ink-muted}` — #615d59): supporting / muted copy.
- **Ash** (`{colors.ink-faint}` — #a39e98): captions, metadata, placeholder text.

### Semantic
Notion's marketing surfaces do not expose a dedicated error/success palette in the system chrome — status is carried by the sticker palette (e.g. `{colors.accent-green}` for affirmative ticks) rather than a separate semantic ramp.

## Typography

### Font Family
The entire system is set in **`NotionInter`** — Notion's tuned cut of Inter — with a fallback stack of `Inter, -apple-system, system-ui, "Segoe UI", Helvetica, Arial`. A single family carries everything from 64px display headlines to 12px eyebrows; there is no serif, no monospace display face. OpenType `lnum` (lining numerals) and `locl` features are enabled on body and heading roles.

### Hierarchy

| Token | Size | Weight | Line Height | Letter Spacing | Use |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| `{typography.display-1}` | 64px | 700 | 1.0 | −2.125px | Hero headline ("Meet the night shift") |
| `{typography.display-2}` | 54px | 700 | 1.04 | −1.875px | Large section headlines |
| `{typography.heading-1}` | 40px | 700 | 1.1 | −1px | Section headlines ("Plans and features") |
| `{typography.heading-2}` | 26px | 700 | 1.23 | −0.625px | Sub-section headings |
| `{typography.heading-3}` | 22px | 700 | 1.27 | −0.25px | Card titles |
| `{typography.title}` | 20px | 600 | 1.4 | −0.125px | Feature titles, callouts |
| `{typography.body-md}` | 16px | 400 | 1.5 | 0 | Default body copy |
| `{typography.body-sm}` | 15px | 400 | 1.33 | 0 | Dense body, table rows, nav |
| `{typography.button}` | 16px | 500 | 1.5 | 0 | Button labels |
| `{typography.caption}` | 14px | 400 | 1.43 | 0 | Captions, footnotes |
| `{typography.eyebrow}` | 12px | 600 | 1.33 | +0.125px | Pill badges, small labels |

### Principles
Notion's type voice is **tight, heavy, and quiet-confident**. Headlines lean on weight 700 and aggressive negative tracking (more negative the larger the size) so display copy feels set, not stretched. Body copy stays at a comfortable 1.5 line-height for document readability. The contrast between a heavy 700 headline and a calm 400 body is the primary expressive lever — there is no decorative typography, only a clear hierarchy.

### Note on Font Substitutes
`NotionInter` is a proprietary tuning of the open-source **Inter** family — substitute Inter directly. To approximate Notion's display tightness, apply the negative letter-spacing values in the table above explicitly (Inter at default tracking will read looser than `NotionInter`).

## Layout

### Spacing System
- **Base unit**: 8px.
- **Tokens (front matter)**: `{spacing.xxs}` 4px · `{spacing.xs}` 8px · `{spacing.sm}` 12px · `{spacing.md}` 16px · `{spacing.lg}` 24px · `{spacing.xl}` 28px · `{spacing.xxl}` 32px.
- Card interior padding lands around `{spacing.lg}` (24px); utility buttons use a tight 4px/14px; form fields pad at `{spacing.xxs}`-scale 6px. Section gaps stack the larger steps.

### Grid & Container
Content is centred in a wide max-width column (~1080–1300px on desktop per the extracted breakpoints) with generous outer gutters. Feature sections alternate between full-width text blocks and 2-up / 3-up card grids; the pricing page widens to a 4-column plan table. The dark hero spans full-bleed edge to edge while body sections respect the centred container.

### Whitespace Philosophy
Whitespace is the primary grouping device. Sections are separated by large vertical gaps rather than rules, and cards sit on the warm canvas with quiet hairlines instead of heavy frames. The effect is document-like: airy, scannable, and never crowded.

### Responsive Strategy

#### Breakpoints
| Name | Width | Key Changes |
|---|---|---|
| Wide | 1440px+ | Full multi-column grids, widest container |
| Desktop | 1080–1300px | Standard centred container, 3-up card grids |
| Tablet | 768–840px | Grids collapse to 2-up, nav begins condensing |
| Mobile | ≤600px | Single-column stacks, hamburger nav, full-width CTAs |

#### Touch Targets
Pill CTAs (`button-primary`, `button-secondary`) and utility buttons (`button-utility`) carry comfortable tap padding; aim for a 44×44px minimum hit area on mobile by preserving vertical padding even as labels shrink.

#### Collapsing Strategy
The top nav condenses to a hamburger below the tablet breakpoint; multi-column card grids collapse to a single stacked column; the pricing plan table reflows from 4 side-by-side columns into stacked plan cards. Section padding tightens but the warm-canvas rhythm is preserved.

#### Image Behavior
Product screenshots and illustration tiles sit inside rounded `{rounded.lg}` frames and scale fluidly within their grid cell. Sticker illustrations are small fixed-scale decorative assets that re-flow but do not crop.

## Elevation & Depth

| Level | Treatment | Use |
|---|---|---|
| 0 — Flat | Hairline border `{colors.hairline}`, no shadow | Default cards on the warm canvas |
| 1 — Soft | Layered micro-shadow: `rgba(0,0,0,0.01) 0 0.175px 1.041px`, `0.02 0 0.8px 2.925px`, `0.027 0 2.025px 7.847px`, `0.04 0 4px 18px` | Raised feature cards, floating buttons |
| 2 — Elevated | Deeper 5-stop stack ending in `rgba(0,0,0,0.05) 0 23px 52px` | Modals, popovers, the elevated white pill on the dark hero |

Notion's elevation philosophy is **barely-there**: shadows are built from many near-transparent layers so surfaces feel gently lifted off the paper rather than dramatically dropped. Most cards rely on a hairline alone.

### Decorative Depth
The brand's real depth cue is **illustration**, not shadow. The dark indigo hero (`{colors.secondary}`) uses glowing sticker stickers and a starfield to create a sense of a lit night scene, and feature sections layer small colourful app-icon stickers over plain surfaces to add playful dimensionality. Colour-blocked illustration tiles (purple, pink, orange, teal headers on otherwise-white cards) provide visual rhythm.

## Shapes

### Border Radius Scale

| Token | Value | Use |
|---|---|---|
| `{rounded.xs}` | 4px | Form fields, small tags, inline chips |
| `{rounded.sm}` | 5px | Menu items, list rows, status pills |
| `{rounded.md}` | 8px | Utility / nav buttons, smaller cards |
| `{rounded.lg}` | 12px | Feature cards, illustration frames, content tiles |
| `{rounded.xl}` | 16px | Large containers, image wells |
| `{rounded.full}` | 9999px | Marketing pill CTAs, badges, circular icon buttons |

### Photography Geometry
Product screenshots are framed in rounded `{rounded.lg}` / `{rounded.xl}` wells, typically full-bleed within their container with a hairline edge. Illustration tiles use colour-blocked header bands above white card bodies. Avatars and app-icon stickers are small, sometimes fully circular (`{rounded.full}`). There is no heavy art-direction crop — images scale within their rounded frame.

## Components

> **No hover states documented.** Every spec below documents Default and Active/Pressed states only. Variants live as separate `components:` front-matter entries and are described in their own sub-blocks.

### Navigation

**`nav-bar`** — Top navigation
- White surface `{colors.canvas}`, `{colors.ink}` link text at `{typography.body-sm}`, padding `{spacing.md}`. Sits as a slim sticky bar; left wordmark, centre product/solutions menu links, right "Log in" text link plus a `button-utility` "Get Notion free" CTA. Condenses to a hamburger below the tablet breakpoint.

### Buttons

**`button-primary`** — Primary CTA ("Get Notion free")
- Background `{colors.primary}`, text `{colors.on-primary}`, type `{typography.button}`, fully pill-shaped `{rounded.full}`. The single blue action on any page.
- Pressed state lives in `button-primary-pressed` (background `{colors.primary-active}`); marketing buttons also apply a brief `scale(0.9)` press transform.

**`button-primary-pressed`**
- Background `{colors.primary-active}`, text `{colors.on-primary}` — the depressed state of the primary CTA.

**`button-secondary`** — Secondary CTA ("Request a demo")
- White surface `{colors.surface}`, text `{colors.ink}`, type `{typography.button}`, pill `{rounded.full}`, carried by the soft Level-1 shadow. Pairs beside `button-primary` in the hero.

**`button-utility`** — Nav / plan-select button
- White surface `{colors.surface}`, text `{colors.ink}`, type `{typography.button}`, tighter `{rounded.md}` (8px), padding `4px 14px`, 1px `{colors.hairline}` border. Used for the nav CTA and pricing plan-select buttons where the marketing pill would be too large.

**`button-icon-circular`** — Carousel / media control
- Circular `{rounded.full}` control with a translucent `rgba(0,0,0,0.05)` fill and `{colors.on-primary}` glyph, used for slide and play/pause controls; applies a `scale(0.9)` press transform.

### Cards & Containers

**`feature-card`** — Content / feature card
- White surface `{colors.surface}`, `{colors.ink}` text, `{typography.body-md}`, rounded `{rounded.lg}` (12px), padding `{spacing.lg}` (24px). The workhorse marketing card; often topped by a colour-blocked illustration band from the sticker palette. Default elevation is flat (hairline only).

**`feature-card-elevated`** — Raised feature card
- Same chrome as `feature-card` with the soft Level-1 layered shadow for cards that float above the canvas (testimonials, floating product panels).

**`pricing-plan-card`** — Pricing plan column
- White surface `{colors.surface}`, `{colors.ink}` text, `{typography.body-sm}`, rounded `{rounded.md}` (8px), padding `{spacing.lg}`. A bordered column listing a plan's price and feature checklist, with a `button-utility` select action.

**`pricing-plan-card-featured`** — Highlighted plan column
- Warm `{colors.canvas-soft}` fill to lift the recommended tier off the white siblings, same `{rounded.md}` shape and padding. Distinguished by surface tint rather than a coloured border.

### Inputs & Forms

**`text-input`** — Text / number field
- White surface `{colors.surface}`, `{colors.ink}` text, `{typography.body-sm}`, 1px `rgb(221,221,221)` border, rounded `{rounded.xs}` (4px), padding `6px`. Square-ish corners deliberately tighter than the pill CTAs. Focus adds the soft Level-1 shadow.

### Signature Components

**`hero-band`** — Dark "night" hero
- Full-bleed deep indigo `{colors.secondary}` band carrying `{typography.display-1}` white headline, sticker-constellation field, and a `button-primary` + `button-secondary` CTA pair. The single inverted dark island in an otherwise daylight page.

**`badge-pill`** — Eyebrow / category pill
- White surface `{colors.surface}`, `{colors.primary}` text, `{typography.eyebrow}` (12px / 600), fully pill `{rounded.full}`, padding `4px 8px`. Small labels such as the pricing "Essential for staying organized" eyebrow and category tags.

**`footer`** — Site footer
- Warm `{colors.canvas-soft}` band, `{colors.ink-secondary}` link text at `{typography.caption}`, padding `{spacing.xxl}`. Multi-column link directory closing every page.

### Examples (illustrative)

> Kit-mirror demonstration surfaces. Each `ex-*` entry references brand-native primitives so downstream consumers (`/preview-design`, `/generate-kit`) re-skin the same 10 surfaces consistently.

**`ex-pricing-tier`** — Default Pricing tier card. Re-uses feature-card chrome with brand canvas-soft surface.
- Properties: `backgroundColor`, `textColor`, `borderColor`, `rounded`, `padding`

**`ex-pricing-tier-featured`** — Featured/highlighted tier — polarity-flipped surface (dark fill + light text in light mode, light fill + dark text in dark mode).
- Properties: `backgroundColor`, `textColor`, `rounded`, `padding`

**`ex-product-selector`** — What's Included summary card — re-purposed for SaaS / B2B verticals (NOT a literal product gallery).
- Properties: `backgroundColor`, `rounded`, `padding`

**`ex-cart-drawer`** — Subscription summary — re-purposed for SaaS / B2B (line items per add-on, not literal cart).
- Properties: `backgroundColor`, `rounded`, `padding`, `item-divider`

**`ex-app-shell-row`** — Sidebar nav row inside the App Shell example. Active state uses brand primary as the indicator.
- Properties: `backgroundColor`, `activeIndicator`, `rounded`, `padding`

**`ex-data-table-cell`** — Default data-table th + td chrome. Header uses mono-caps eyebrow typography; body uses body-sm.
- Properties: `headerBackground`, `headerTypography`, `bodyTypography`, `cellPadding`, `rowBorder`

**`ex-auth-form-card`** — Sign-in / sign-up card. Re-uses feature-card chrome with text-input primitives inside.
- Properties: `backgroundColor`, `rounded`, `padding`

**`ex-modal-card`** — Modal dialog surface — same chrome as feature-card with elevated shadow.
- Properties: `backgroundColor`, `rounded`, `padding`

**`ex-empty-state-card`** — Empty-state illustration frame.
- Properties: `backgroundColor`, `rounded`, `padding`, `captionTypography`

**`ex-toast`** — Toast notification surface — feature-card shape + medium shadow.
- Properties: `backgroundColor`, `rounded`, `padding`, `typography`


## Do's and Don'ts

### Do
- Reserve `{colors.primary}` for the primary action, inline links, and the active/focus signal — nothing decorative.
- Keep the page on the warm `{colors.canvas-soft}` canvas; use pure white `{colors.surface}` for cards and fields to create gentle figure/ground.
- Let the sticker palette (`{colors.accent-pink}`, `{colors.accent-teal}`, `{colors.accent-orange}`, …) live only in illustrations, icon tiles and category dots.
- Set headlines in heavy `{typography.display-1}`/`{typography.heading-1}` with their negative tracking applied explicitly.
- Use pill `{rounded.full}` for marketing CTAs and tighter `{rounded.md}` for nav/utility buttons — the contrast is intentional.
- Define surfaces with `{colors.hairline}` and the barely-there Level-1 shadow rather than heavy drop-shadows.
- Reserve the deep indigo `{colors.secondary}` "night" treatment for a single hero moment, not repeated bands.

### Don't
- Don't paint a CTA or structural fill in any sticker-palette colour — those are decoration only.
- Don't introduce a second structural accent alongside `{colors.primary}`.
- Don't put pill `{rounded.full}` radii on form fields — inputs stay tight at `{rounded.xs}` (4px).
- Don't drop heavy shadows; Notion's elevation is many near-transparent layers, never a hard cast.
- Don't set body copy in a heavy weight — keep 400 for readability and let weight 700 belong to headlines.
- Don't place type on pure clinical white for full pages; the warm `{colors.canvas-soft}` is core to the brand calm.

## EKS 업무 화면 적용 규칙 (2026-10-21)

이 문서를 유일한 디자인 기준으로 사용한다. 아래 규칙은 위 브랜드 원칙을 인증 업무 화면에 적용하는 사용자 확정 사항이다. 기존 라이트/다크 선택 및 별도 테마 정책은 폐지한다. 마케팅 예시의 다크 hero, 대형 display, 장식 팔레트를 업무 화면에 새로 추가하지 않는다.

- **단일 밝은 스타일:** 바탕 `#F6F5F4`, 패널·입력 `#FFFFFF`, 본문 `#000000`, 보조 설명 `#615D59`, 주요 행동 `#0075DE`, 눌림 `#005BAB`. 상태는 중립 배경과 아이콘·명칭으로 구분한다. 예전 브라우저 테마 설정은 읽거나 삭제하지 않는다.
- **작업 폭:** 일반 화면·홈·개별 편집 최대 1280px, 관리 목록·시스템 운영·Excel 표 작업 최대 1760px. 역할별 홈 구성, 검색·필터·페이지, 목록 밀도 40/48px는 유지한다. 큰 표만 내부 가로 스크롤을 사용한다.
- **글꼴·위계:** Inter 대체 글꼴과 한글 Pretendard를 사용한다. 제목 700(40/26/22px), 본문 400(16px), 관리 표 15px, 버튼 500. 좁은 화면의 큰 제목은 32px까지 줄인다. 목록·탭 요약 이외의 긴 내용은 줄바꿈하여 전부 읽을 수 있어야 한다.
- **형태·간격:** 입력 4px, 보조 버튼 8px, 패널 12px, 대화상자 16px. 주요 행동은 pill 형태를 사용한다. 4·8·12·16·24·28·32px 간격 체계를 기본으로 하고 표·문항·일정은 업무 밀도에 맞춰 조정한다. 아이콘과 라벨은 flex/grid 정렬을 사용한다.
- **대비:** `ink-faint`는 의미 있는 작은 글자에 사용하지 않는다. 종이색 배경의 작은 링크는 `#005BAB`을 사용한다. `hairline`은 장식 구분선이고 입력·필수 조작 경계는 `#615D59`로 구분한다. 일반 글자 4.5:1, 큰 글자·필수 조작 경계 3:1 이상을 검증한다.
- **접근성:** 모바일 주요 조작은 44px 이상이다. 오류 입력을 중앙으로 이동하여 고정 저장 영역에 가리지 않는다. 대화상자는 제목·초점·키보드 닫기, 탭은 `tablist/tab/tabpanel`·연결 ID·선택 상태·좌우/Home/End 이동을 제공한다.
- **학습 항목·문항 탐색:** 왼쪽 세로 번호(1, 2, 3)와 오른쪽 한 항목 편집을 사용한다. 번호 외 이름은 본문·툴팁·접근 가능한 이름에서 확인한다. 44px 이상 조작, 좁은 고정 폭(모바일 약 48px), 내부 세로 스크롤, 위/아래·Home/End 이동, 안정적인 ID 선택, 오류·미응답 표식을 제공한다. 모바일에서도 가로 탭으로 바꾸지 않는다.
- **평가 편집·응시:** 상단 지식/상황 대응 유형 탭과 내부 세로 문항 탐색을 연결된 패널로 구성한다. 상황 설명과 대응 질문을 구분한다. 두 유형 모두 선택지 정답 라디오·번호·여러 줄 내용·삭제를 제공한다. 학습자는 응답 수·이전/다음·제출 전 답안 확인을 사용하며 판정자 승인 UI는 없다.
- **구현:** `design-tokens.css`의 단일 팔레트, `style.css` 공통/업무 레이아웃, `course-editor.css` 문항 편집, `catalog.css` 일괄 관리 구조를 사용한다. 이전 테마 CSS/스크립트는 유지하지 않는다. Tabulator는 앱/표 범위 선택자로 스타일링하여 지연 로딩에도 같은 팔레트를 적용한다.


### 조직 정책·프로세스 검증 안내 (2026-10-21)

- 조직 깊이는 업무상 제한하지 않는다. 트리 들여쓰기는 시각적으로 최대 5단계 폭까지만 늘리고 Lv 숫자·전체 경로로 깊이를 전달한다. 사용자 소속 선택기는 필요한 레벨만 추가한다.
- 필수 자격은 상태 문구·이유·다음 행동을 같은 행에 표시하고 모바일에서는 세로로 배치한다. 미설정과 명시적인 빈 목록을 구분한다.
- 학습 안내와 평가 선택은 별도 단계로 표현한다. 직접 작성 자료는 인라인으로 읽고 외부 자료는 유형·이름·설명과 함께 연다.
- 모든 페이지 본문 마지막에 비고정 `MVP 프로세스 검토`를 둔다. 기본 접힘이며 중립 바탕·점선 경계·32px 외부 간격으로 업무 패널과 분리한다. 요약에는 현재 단계와 펼치기 행동을 표시한다. 새 페이지·주요 작업 단계·계정·관리 조직 변경 시 다시 접고 같은 화면의 입력 중에는 유지한다.
- 전체 흐름의 현재 단계를 문자·테두리·굵기로 강조한다. 업무 행동/이후 흐름과 정적 AI 검수 설명은 데스크톱 두 열, 768px 이하 한 열이다. 펼친 안내는 일반 문서 흐름을 따르며 저장 영역과 입력을 가리지 않는다.
- 가상 표는 자체 초점·스크롤을 사용한다. 전역 입력 가림 방지가 표 편집 중 페이지를 움직여 다른 행에 클릭이 전달되지 않도록 한다.

### 관리자 범위·공지·본문과 공통 탐색 (2026-10-21)

- 인증 업무 관리의 공통 사이드바를 기준 일괄 관리에서도 유지한다. 오른쪽 화면만 전환하며 관리 조직·제목을 중복 표시하지 않는다. 1024px 이하에서는 같은 메뉴를 접어 두고 현재 메뉴·열기 버튼을 제공한다. 가로 스크롤은 표 내부에서만 사용한다.
- 조직 선택은 허용된 조직의 트리이며 선택 불가능한 상위 경로는 별도 경로 안내다. 조직 선택 아래에 해당 조직 정보·관리자 지정·필수 자격을 두고 팀 후보 편집은 별도 펼침 영역으로 둔다.
- 설명 본문은 400 굵기·줄 높이 1.6, 제목과 설명 8~12px, 문단 12px, 의미 구획 24px를 사용한다. h4 이하에도 브라우저 기본 여백을 남기지 않는다. 사용자 입력 줄바꿈은 보존하고 긴 URL·경로는 영역 안에서 줄바꿈한다. 표와 입력 폼의 기존 밀도는 유지한다.
- 자격 설명·개인 목표·일정을 구분하고 날짜는 라벨/값 그리드로 정렬한다. 모바일에서는 한 열로 전환한다.
- 홈 공지는 시스템 공지와 내 팀 공지를 각각 별도 영역·게시 대상·빈 상태로 제공한다. 공지 상세에도 대상을 표시한다. 운영자의 업무 관리 조직과 실제 소속 팀을 혼동하지 않는다.
